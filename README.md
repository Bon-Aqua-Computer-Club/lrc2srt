The [lrc2srt](https://bon-aqua-computer-club.github.io/lrc2srt/) tool converts a
properly-formatted LRC file into a simlpe SRT, which can then be employed as a
subtitles source for the purpose of producing FFmpeg lyrics music videos.

## Instructions
Paste your LRC string into the first text box, then hit the "Submit" button. The
second text box will reveal your SRT string. Copy and paste this data into a new
file, with the extension `.srt`. **Voila!**
